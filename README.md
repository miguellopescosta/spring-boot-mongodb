# spring-boot-mongodb
Funny assignment with Spring Boot, Spring Data, Spring Web and Google Guava CacheLoader.

After compiling the project, you can run it on Tomcat. I used Tomcat 9.0.54. In order to run on Wildfly, you'll need some adjustments.

If you wish to run the project on Intelli J, please, remove the following dependency from pom.xml.

      <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-tomcat</artifactId>
      <scope>provided</scope>
      </dependency>
